"""Typed review stages for the Facts Gate (Phase 8B Step 3).

Splits the single-pass Facts review into per-topic stages so each LLM
call sees only the relevant subset of the FactsPatch + relevant evidence.
This directly reduces the prompt size (from ~38 KB monolithic to per-stage
~8–15 KB) and focuses the model's attention on one topic at a time.

Stages are **additive**: each produces its own findings and the gate
aggregates them exactly the same way as the monolithic reviewer's findings.

Backward compatible: when ``stage_split=False`` (the default in the policy),
the gate continues to use the monolithic ``build_facts_review_prompt``.
