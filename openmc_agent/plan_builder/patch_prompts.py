Rules:
- Extract benchmark facts from the requirement; do NOT invent numbers.
- If variant is 3A/3B, set selected_variant.
- If requirement mentions spacer grids, set has_spacer_grids=true.
- If requirement mentions Pyrex/thimble plug/guide tube/instrument tube, set has_special_pin_map=true.
- Determine model_scope: single_assembly for one assembly, multi_assembly_core for N×N cores.
- For multi-assembly cores: set assembly_count, core_lattice_size, assembly_type_counts.
- For multi-assembly cores: use scoped_expected_counts with explicit scope, NOT legacy fields.
- Do NOT divide core totals by assembly count to guess per-assembly counts.
- Legacy fields (expected_pin_count etc.) are for single_assembly only.
- Unknown facts go into missing_facts, NOT fabricated values.
- If the source specifies multiple fuel enrichments or compositions, declare each as a
  fuel_variant_requirements entry with variant_id, enrichment, density, and which
  assembly_type_ids use it. This is the source-of-truth for fuel identity.
- If the source document says certain assembly types contain control rods, RCCA,
  absorber inserts, burnable poisons, or other localized inserts that must be
  PHYSICALLY PLACED at specific coordinates, declare a localized_insert_requirements
  entry for each kind. Defining materials, universes, or profiles for an insert
  does NOT satisfy this requirement — the entry declares that placement is REQUIRED.
  Fields:
  * requirement_id: unique identifier for this requirement
  * insert_kind: pyrex_rod|thimble_plug|control_rod|absorber_insert|instrumentation_insert|custom
  * assembly_type_ids: which assembly type IDs must contain this insert
  * expected_coordinate_count_per_assembly: how many paths per assembly instance
  * expected_assembly_instance_count: how many assembly instances have this insert
  * host_kind: guide_tube|instrument_tube|custom
  * required_profile_id: the axial profile ID this insert must reference (or null)
  * required_segment_roles: roles of the required profile segments (e.g., ["absorber","plenum"])
  * expected_insert_universe_ids: universe IDs the insert should use
  * anchor_z_cm: the source-specified operating position (e.g., poison bottom)
  * control_state_id: the current operating state label
  * required_in_detailed_domain: whether the insert must appear in the detailed lattice
- A requirement entry must NOT be omitted just because the insert has materials or
  universes defined. The requirement is the source contract for placement.

  "assumptions": []}}

Rules:
- Do NOT generate universes, cells, lattices, or axial structures.
- Zircaloy-4 is NOT pure Zr; SS-304 is NOT pure Fe; Inconel-718 is NOT pure Ni.
- If composition is incomplete, set composition_status to "needs_library" or "needs_confirmation".
- approximate alloy is allowed ONLY with composition_status="approximate" AND an explicit warning.
- Never set composition_status="confirmed" for a known multi-element alloy with a single-element composition.
- When the input specifies a homogenized structural slab (for example a nozzle,
  support plate, baffle, or other steel/coolant structure), define a distinct
  material with role="structural" and mixture_components referencing the existing
  structural and coolant material IDs with the input-provided volume fractions.
  Do not represent that mixture only in an assumption and do not substitute pure
  coolant for the structural slab.
- Cross section paths do NOT belong here.
- If fuel_variant_requirements are present in Context, define one fuel material per
  variant. Set source_variant_id on each role="fuel" material to match the variant_id.
- Do NOT merge different enrichments into one fuel material.
- Do NOT define a required fuel material and leave it unused.
- OpenMC composition entries MUST be transport-ready element or nuclide names only.
  Chemical formulas such as B2O3, SiO2, UO2, H2O, and Al2O3 are NOT nuclide names:
  never place them directly in composition.
- Put source chemical compounds in compound_components. Every component MUST include
  fraction, fraction_basis (weight_frac or atom_frac), and isotope_policy.
- For ordinary compounds with no isotope vector, use isotope_policy="natural_elements".
  For enriched fuel compounds, provide explicit isotope composition; never reduce
  enriched UO2 to generic U and O, and do not overwrite a fuel variant requirement.
- Every material must be transport-ready after deterministic species resolution.

composition_basis semantics (MUST declare for every material with a composition):
- "atom_frac": each value is an atom fraction (e.g., U235=3.1 means 3.1 at% U-235).
- "weight_frac": each value is a weight fraction (e.g., Zr=98.2 means 98.2 wt% Zr).
- "atom_density_barn_cm": each value is an absolute atom density in atoms/barn-cm
  (use this when the source gives values like 2.233e-2).
- "stoichiometric_ratio": the fuel nuclides sum to ~100 (enrichment vector,
  e.g., U235=3.1 means 3.1 at% of the uranium) and the oxygen entry gives the
  O/U ratio (e.g., O16=2.0 means O/U=2 for UO2).
  Use this when the source specifies enrichment per-100-uranium and oxygen as
  a molecular ratio. If U isotopes sum to ~100 and O16 is a small number
  like 2.0, this is ALWAYS stoichiometric_ratio, NEVER weight_frac.
- "ppm_by_weight": a coolant entry like B10=1066 means 1066 ppm total boron
  by weight (NOT an atom fraction).  Use this when the source gives boron
  concentration in ppm.
- "unknown": only if truly unclear; this will BLOCK rendering and require retry.

Rules:
- Do NOT generate the lattice, full pin map, or axial layers.
- Each universe must have at least one cell.
- guide_tube must include internal coolant AND tube wall material.
- thimble_plug is a guide tube with a plug inside: it MUST keep the same tube wall
  (Zircaloy-4 annulus) as a guide_tube, plus a water gap between the plug and the
  wall. Do NOT make it a solid rod of cladding material with water outside.
  Correct cell order (inside→out):
    plug (SS304 cylinder) → water_gap (water annulus) → wall (Zircaloy-4 annulus) → outer_coolant (water background)
- pyrex_rod must include ALL gap layers from the input spec, not just pyrex+clad.
  A pyrex rod has concentric annuli with thin gas/water gaps between solid layers.
  Do NOT merge a gap into an adjacent solid layer. Correct cell order (inside→out):
    inner_water_or_helium (cylinder, inside inner tube)
    → inner_tube (SS304 annulus)
    → gap_1 (water or helium annulus, between inner tube and pyrex)
    → pyrex (pyrex glass annulus)
    → gap_2 (water or helium annulus, between pyrex and outer clad)
    → outer_clad (SS304 annulus)
    → outer_coolant (water background)
  Use the exact radii from the input problem description for each layer boundary.
  If the input does not specify a gap, insert a thin water annulus (0.001–0.01 cm).
- fuel_pin should have a fuel material cell.
- Mark through-path cells with protected_through_path=true.
- If Context shows N distinct fuel_variant_requirements, generate at least N distinct
  active-fuel universes (one per variant). Each active-fuel universe must use exactly
  one fuel material whose source_variant_id matches.
- Do NOT collapse different fuel enrichments into one generic fuel_pin universe.
- Every required fuel material must be reachable via at least one active-fuel universe.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Do NOT output the full 17x17 lattice. Do NOT enumerate all 289 cells.
- Do NOT output rows of fuel_pin_universe.
- ONLY output special coordinate lists and default_universe_id.
- lattice_size is [rows, cols], e.g. [17, 17].
- coordinate_convention.index_base must be 0 or 1.
- Each coordinate is [row, col] using the stated convention.
- guide_tube_coords lists ALL persistent guide tube paths (full assembly height).
  This includes positions that will host localized inserts (Pyrex, thimble plugs, etc.).
  A guide tube coordinate that hosts an insert is still a guide_tube_coord —
  the insert only affects a specific z range within that guide tube.
- localized_insert_intents declares finite-height inserts (Pyrex rods, thimble plugs,
  absorbers, control rods). Each intent specifies:
  * insert_kind: pyrex_rod | thimble_plug | absorber_insert | control_rod | custom
  * host_kind: guide_tube (the host path whose inner component is replaced)
  * insert_universe_id: the universe to use inside the host for this z range
  * coordinates: positions affected (must be a subset of guide_tube_coords)
  * z_min_cm, z_max_cm: the axial interval where the insert is active
  * application_mode: "nested_component_override" (default, preserves host wall)
  * component_role: role of the replaced inner component (e.g. "internal_coolant")
  * preserve_component_roles: roles to keep (e.g. ["tube_wall", "outer_coolant"])
- Coordinates of localized inserts MUST also appear in guide_tube_coords.
- Do NOT put insert universes as base lattice positions.
- Do NOT stretch a finite insert over the full assembly height.

Rules:
- Do NOT generate materials/universes/lattice/full plan.
- For fill_type="material", fill_id MUST be one of Context.known_material_ids. Do not
  invent homogenized mixture IDs; use an existing ID or mark the layer for human
  confirmation when no supported material is available.
- lower_nozzle, upper_nozzle, and core_plate are whole-cross-section structural
  slabs. They MUST use an existing material whose Context material role is
  structural/steel/mixture, never a coolant/moderator material merely because the
  slab is homogenized with coolant. Do not encode a steel/coolant mixture only as
  an assumption while filling the layer with pure coolant.
- For fill_type="universe" and every transformation replacement_universe_id,
  use only Context.known_universe_ids. Do not invent end-plug or plenum universes.
- active_fuel layer must exist if the problem is a 3D fuel assembly.
- active_fuel fill_type should be "lattice" and fill_id should be "assembly_lattice".
- Do NOT use default z=-1..1 for an explicit 3D benchmark.
- If z values are unknown, set requires_human_confirmation=true; do NOT fabricate.
- Do NOT represent spacer grids as axial layer material slabs.
- Do NOT enumerate every default fuel-pin coordinate. Use replace_universe_family
  for component profiles shared by all pins of a universe family.
- Use sparse coordinate_override only for localized positions.
- Use nested_component_override when an insert occupies the inside of an existing
  tube and the tube wall must remain.
- IMPORTANT: If localized_insert_intents are declared in the pin_map, do NOT
  create separate lattice_loadings for those inserts. The assembler automatically
  derives loadings from localized_insert_intents. Only create lattice_loadings
  for fuel-component-profile transformations (replace_universe_family) and
  for inserts NOT declared as localized_insert_intents.
- Use loading_ids when an axial layer requires more than one localized loading.
- Spacer grids remain axial_overlays, not lattice transformations.
- Component-profile layers (end_plug, plenum, gas_gap, shoulder_gap) must use lattice fill
  with a replace_universe_family transformation, NOT a whole-layer material slab.
- shoulder_gap is the moderator region between the fuel stack and the nozzle/end structure.
  Guide tubes and instrument tubes continue through it. Use role "shoulder_gap"
  (or "lower_shoulder_gap" / "upper_shoulder_gap" for positional clarity).
  fill_type must be "lattice" with fill_id "assembly_lattice" and a loading_id that
  replaces only the fuel-pin family with a moderator-only universe.
  Do NOT use fill_type=material for shoulder_gap.
  Do NOT label shoulder_gap as lower_plenum/upper_plenum.

Transformation operation_kind values:
- "replace_universe_family": source_universe_id -> replacement_universe_id for all positions.
- "coordinate_override": specific target_coordinates -> replacement_universe_id.

  cell to replace; preserve_component_roles lists cells that must survive.

  This preserves through-paths (fuel, clad, guide tubes) while adding the grid frame.
- For geometry_mode="mass_conserving_outer_frame" or "homogenized_open_region", you MUST set
  through_path_preserved=true. This is a required field for these modes.
- total_mass_g is REQUIRED for geometry_mode="mass_conserving_outer_frame". Read the grid
  mass per assembly from the source document (e.g., end grid 1017 g, middle grid 875 g).
- Only use geometry_mode="homogenized_open_region" when mass data is truly unavailable.

- Different assembly types CAN share universe IDs ONLY when the source facts
  explicitly show they use the same fuel variant and same base pin geometry.
- If the source specifies different enrichment, fuel composition, or fuel region
  for different assembly types, they MUST NOT share the active-fuel default universe.
- Localized inserts being the same or different must NOT mask a fuel material
  difference. Check fuel variant first.
- If fuel_variant_requirements are in Context, set fuel_variant_id on each
  fuel assembly type to match the variant for its assembly_type_id.
- default_universe_id must use a universe whose fuel material has the same
  source_variant_id as the assembly type's fuel_variant_id.
- The multiplicity_hint is advisory; the core_layout patch determines actual placement.
- Every localized_insert_requirement in Context MUST be fulfilled by a matching
  localized_insert_intent in the corresponding assembly type's pin_map.
- An assembly type whose name or role contains "control" or "RCCA" MUST have a
  localized_insert_intent with insert_kind="control_rod" — the name alone does
  NOT satisfy the placement requirement.
- Defining control-rod universes or profiles does NOT satisfy placement. You MUST
  create a localized_insert_intent with actual coordinates, axial_profile_id,
  anchor_z_cm, and control_state_id matching the requirement.
- Multi-segment control rods MUST reference an axial_profile_id from Context.
  The insert_universe_id is the initial/compatible segment universe; the actual
  multi-segment structure is resolved from the profile.
- Intent coordinates MUST be actual positions — do NOT leave empty.
- Intent anchor_z_cm must match the source operating state.
- control_state_id must match the current selected variant/state.
- Localized inserts MUST NOT be written to axial_overlays.
- Do NOT permanently bake control rods into the base pin lattice.
- Do NOT put instrument-tube coordinates in a control_rod intent.

Rules:
- Define ONLY reusable axial profiles — no pin coordinates, no core layout.
- Each segment uses RELATIVE coordinates (relative to anchor point).
- Each segment MUST reference a universe already defined in the universes patch.
- Segments MUST be ordered by relative_z (ascending), no overlaps.
- Mechanical gaps between segments MUST be explicitly modeled or noted in assumptions.
- Do NOT adjust profiles based on keff or criticality targets.
- For movable inserts (control rods), the ACTUAL position is provided by intent.anchor_z_cm,
  NOT the profile. The profile only defines the relative structure.
- anchor_kind determines coordinate translation: bottom=additive, top=subtractive, center=bilateral.
- Use anchor_kind="absolute" only when segments are already in global coordinates.
